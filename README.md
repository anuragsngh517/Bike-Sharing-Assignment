# Linear Regression Assignment

> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. 

Given the set of data of the previous yearsm 4
 we have to make few assumptions about the growth of the business in the coming year.
